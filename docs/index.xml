      <description>Since the beginning of October, we may participate in a new event: Unexpected Revolt
This event features a new investigation &amp;ndash; a priority assignment &amp;ndash; on the planet of Marsonia-III. More or less it&amp;rsquo;s story revels around a missing inquisitor. Choices throughout the assignment drive the story into different directions and to new missions. After finishing enough missions, you can reap the fruits. As always, your overall success rating influences the glory you deserve.</description>

      <description>Hello there!
This is my attempt at a little blog about Warhammer 40k Inquisitor. It is not that I have much to say, but it is a great game which I enjoy and perhaps want to write about.
May the Emperor protect you!
